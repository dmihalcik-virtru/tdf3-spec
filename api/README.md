# API

This directory contains OpenAPI (swagger) definitions of the TDF service APIs.

## Swagger Editor
An editor is available for viewing and updating the Swagger API definitions.  It runs in a background Docker container; the user interface is browser based. Use these bash scripts to start and stop it:   

```bash
$ sh scripts/open_api_editor
$ sh scripts/close_api_editor
```

The editor's user interface is accessed via browser at localhost:80.
